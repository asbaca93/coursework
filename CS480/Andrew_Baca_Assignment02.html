This command would be particularly useful for somebody who compresses files a lot who wants to see if there is a more efficient way to manage space, or whether you would be saving space or not by  compressing the files.  </p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="P3">1.2) <span class="T1">find</span></p><p class="P4">The find command is used to search the file tree structure for a given target, whether it be a certain directory, a certain filename, or certain permissions granted to certain files or directories.  <span class="T4">The find command starts the directory tree traversal at a specified starting point, and if none are specified, then ‘.’ is assumed, meaning the whole tree.  </span>The -H, -L, and -P options deal with the symbolic links, pertaining to whether symbolic links should be followed or not.  <span class="T4">If you were to use the -D debugoptions, this will print diagnostic information as the directory tree is being traversed.  </span></p><p class="P5">One option that you may want to use if you were investigating a crime scene, and a Linux laptop was a primary piece of evidence is the -atime n command, so you can see exactly which files have been accessed.  If you thing a file has been tampered with during the crime, you would want to use the           -ctime command, which will give the investigator which files have been changed under a specified amount of time.  </p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P5">1.3) <span class="T1">grep</span></p><p class="P6">the grep command can be used to find patterns in a given file, or working directory, and prints the matching lines.  The patterns being searched for can be represented using regular expressions, which is an expression that can represent a pattern in a string.  Grep understands three different syntax’s of regular expressions and they are basic, extended, and perl.  Some common options <span class="T5">within</span> the grep command include -<span class="T5">c, which prints out the number of lines that match a given pattern, as well as -l which will list the file names that contain the matching pattern, and -n , which will display the matching lines and their respected line numbers.  </span></p><p class="P7">One option that you may want to use -H if you are only interested in what files contain the pattern you are searching for while using grep command. You may want to delete all the files that have a certain persons name in a given directory, so you would use the grep command with the -H option to find all the files to delete.  </p><p class="P7"> </p><p class="P7">1.4) <span class="T1">kill</span></p><p class="P7">Kill is the command used to terminate a process, and when it is called, <span class="T6">the kill command sends a specified signal to process(es). The default signal is called TERM, and it is used to terminate a process if no signal is specified.  When kill is called, the processes specified can be specified by both names </span><span class="T6">and process ID’s.  The kill command has three potential return codes, and they are 0, representing a success, 1, representing a failure, and 64, representing a partial success.  Some common options within the kill command include -s, which is a signal to send given as a name or number, and -l, which will print a list of signal names.  </span></p><p class="P8">One command you may want to use if you are just looking for <span class="T7">the Process ID’s of the processes being killed is</span> <span class="T7">the -p –pid command, which will just print the PID’s and not send any signals. </span></p><p class="P8"> </p><p class="P9">1.5) <span class="T1">lpq</span></p><p class="P9">The lpq command shows the current print queue status on a <span class="T8">specified </span>printer. <span class="T8">Printing jobs will be queued on a default destination if there is no printer specified.  If you are to use the +interval option with the lpq command, you will continuously get feedback pertinent to  the jobs in the queue until its is empty.  Some common options pertinent to lpq are -E, which forces encryption when the server is being connected, -P, which specifies an alternate printer, -U, which specifies an alternate username, and -h to specify an alternate server.  </span></p><p class="P10">A lab administrator may want to use the -a option to see the jobs on all printers. He or she would use this command as sort of a diagnostics check.  </p><p class="P10"> </p><p class="P10">1.6) <span class="T1">lprm</span></p><p class="P10">lprm is a command used to cancel cancel print jobs that are in the queue and waiting to be printed.  If there are no arguments that are given with lprm, then the default would be to cancel the current job on the default destination.  <span class="T9">You can specify more than one job to be canceled with this command.  Some common options to go along with the lprm command include -E, which forces encryption, -P, which specifies printer destination, and -U, which specifies an alternate username.  </span></p><p class="P11">System administrators may want to use the -P option to specify a printer destination if there is multiple printers in the facility that they are administrating.  </p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P11">1.7) <span class="T1">ls + Permissions</span></p><p class="P11">the ls + permissions command List information about the files, which are sorted alphabetically, within a given directory.  The ls + permissions command has an extensive list of options, which will output various bits of information attached to each file within the directory, such as the name of the author, size of the file, list of the directories themselves, modification time, and format.  </p><p class="P11">Somebody may want to use the –author option to find out the creator of each file within a given directory.  A system admin may want to use the -d option with the ls command to see a full list of the directories within. </p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P11">1.8) <span class="T2">man</span></p><p class="P12">the command man refers to an interface within the terminal to the on-line reference manuals. Each page argument that is given to the man command is the name of some program, utility, or, function within your system. When an argument is paired with the man command, a neatly formatted document with descriptions of certain functions and their attributes are printed for the user to scroll.  Man pages are broken into sections containing different functionalities of the given system, and all the information on how to use that tool.  </p><p class="P12">A new computer science major may want to use man pwd to learn basic maneuverability of their terminal and directories, as well as man cd, so they can traverse through the directory tree. </p><p class="P12"> </p><p class="P12">1.9) <span class="T1">scp</span></p><p class="P13">The command scp can be used to securely copy files between a host and a network.  Scp uses ssh(1) for data transfer and other aspects of security, and when called, scp will ask for passwords for authentication.  <span class="T10">File names possibly contain user and host specification to indicate where the file is to </span><span class="T10">be copied to.  Some of the common options within the scp command include -3, which copies between 2 remote host connected through local host, -4, which forcesIPv4, -6, which forces IPv6, and -C, which enables compression. </span></p><p class="P14">If you are concerned about a certain aspects of the SSH encryption technique to use with the scp command, you may want to use the -c cipher command, as well as look into the -F ssh config command.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">1.10) <span class="T1">script</span></p><p class="P14"> the <span class="T11">script</span> command makes a typescript of everything that is displayed on ones terminal.  It is particularly useful whenever a copy <span class="T11">of the work done in the terminal is needed.  If there is a filename given as an argument, then script saves the terminal dialogue into this file. The default file that the script command will write the display into will be titled typescript if no argument is given. Script is terminated by the exit command.  Some options that are included within the display command </span><span class="T13">a – append, which will append to a file, or typescript, -c –command, which will run the command rather than the shell, -e – return, which will return the exit code of the child process, and -f –flush, which will flush the typescript after each use.  </span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T12">One option that may be useful to somebody running the typescript command often might be flush. This would help the user because they wnt have to append through older terminal data every view.  </span></p><p class="P15"><span class="T12"/></p><p class="P15"><span class="T12">1.11) </span><span class="T14">ssh</span></p><p class="P16"><span class="T12">The ssh command is used to access a program used for logging onto a remote machine and for execute commands on that machine, using methods of secure communications between two insecure host. When executing ssh, the user connects and logs onto a host name, and must prove their identity using various methods including public key authentication.  Ssh may get information from a configuration file on the user and system level.  There are various </span><span class="T16">methods</span><span class="T12"> of authentication </span><span class="T16">that are arranged in in an order of preference.  </span></p><p class="P16"><span class="T16">A person may want to use -X forwarding to bypass certain file permissions when using the ssh command to link to another system, although this can lead to security vulnerabilities such as keystroke monitoring.  Alternatively, -x Disables the X11 forwarding.  </span></p><p class="P16"><span class="T16"/></p><p class="P17"><span class="T12">1.12) </span><span class="T14">su</span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T12">The command su allows the user to execute commands through a different user and a group ID.  The default argument for the su command is root, where you will be asked for a password for authentication. </span><span class="T17">With the su command, you can basically switch users if you have the valid login credentials. </span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T17">One option you may want to use with the su command would be -login if you are trying to prevent mixing of environments and want a login environment similar to a real login.</span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T17"/></p><p class="P18"><span class="T17">1.13) </span><span class="T15">sudo</span></p><p class="P18"><span class="T17">the command sudo allows you to execute a command as another user, possibly a user of higher authority. </span><span class="T18">Once executed, the user has to go through authentication, and then is allowed to execute command under that user. The authentication of sudo requires that the users enter their passwords within a certain time span, or it will exit if the time limit is reached.  As a security precaution, administrators may log ones attempts to use the sudo command.  </span></p><p class="P19"><span class="T12">One option that you may want to use while executing sudo is  the -E which means the user requested permission to keep the same environment variables, and it is up to the security policy to allow this or not.  </span></p><p class="P19"><span class="T12"/></p><p class="P19"><span class="T12">1.14) </span><span class="T14">sudoers</span></p><p class="P19"><span class="T12">the sudoers command </span><span class="T19">is a security policy that determines the privileges of sudo. Some common policy in this plugin states that users must use a password to authenticate themselves when the sudo command is called.  If a user tries to run sudo command who is not on a list of acceptable users, mail must be sent to the administrator regarding the command.  There are certain mail bypass flags that can make the proper authority unaware about the sudo execution from a user who is not approved. All attempts to run sudo are logged no matter what.  </span></p><p class="P20"><span class="T12">Sudoers has an extensive set of Boolean options. One might consider running sudoers with the authenticate option if the user would like to identify themselves via password before running commands.  </span></p><p class="P20"><span class="T12"/></p><p class="P20"><span class="T12">1.15) </span><span class="T14">tar</span></p><p class="P20"><span class="T12">The command tar is an archiving tool used to store multiple files into a single file.  Options to the tar command can lead to three different styles, and they are traditional style, unix or short option style, and gnu or long option style.  </span><span class="T20">These different styles are represented as different commands on the terminal. Ideally the tar command always has one option or more linked to it.  </span></p><p class="P21"><span class="T20">O</span><span class="T12">ne may want to use the -A option to concatenate the archived file to the end of another. This would be good for an ongoing project or an ongoing dataset.  </span></p></body></html>
